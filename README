This is the first level I made in Unreal Ed. Its simply a compilation of every type of technical thing you can do within an unreal Ed level in order to teach myself how to do it.

I then exported it as though it were a finished map for distribution to make sure i could get that down. Feel free to look around in it. It has several kismit scripts as well as particle and volumetric effects and ai pathing.
